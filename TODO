1. Pulling down script from github and executing as root is potentially risky
   see https://github.com/diafygi/letsencrypt-nosudo [nosudo requires user interaction - isn't going to work]
2. Cron job executes downloaded script as root as well [need to look at improving this later]
3. What happens if the cronjob fails [1-2 weeks before the cert expires, the user gets an email notifying them.
we could also monitor for cert expiration to notify the end user. we should discuss what we want to do if
renewal fails. I've updated the cronjob to be aware of nginx being installed so the job won't fail if it
hasn't been installed as is the case in the mailshuttle project.]
